## How to contribute


Main branch is sacred. You merge finished things in there. Things are deemed finish once you've gone through `the process``

`The process`:   

- Create a branch for the thing you want to add `git branch feature/my_fancy_branch`. Start the branch with `feature/`. You only ever add feature sized things.   
- Work on it, make the branch as messy as you'd like. Consult iwth other to make sure you're not stepping on their code/work.   
- When you've got something you like, show it off to other team members. 
- When everyone is ok with what you've written and you've gotten the A OK from them. Clean up your code.  
- Create a pull request to main. 
- Merge into main
- Celebrate `the process`
